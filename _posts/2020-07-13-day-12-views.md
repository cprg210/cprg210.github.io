## Topic 1: The Big Picture
See [MVC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/MVC) in the MDN glossary

MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a pattern in software design commonly used to implement user interfaces, data, and controlling logic. It emphasizes a separation between the softwareâ€™s business logic and display. This "separation of concerns" provides for a better division of labor and improved maintenance. Some other design patterns are based on MVC, such as MVVM (Model-View-Viewmodel), MVP (Model-View-Presenter), and MVW (Model-View-Whatever).

The three parts of the MVC software-design pattern can be described as follows:

- Model: Manages data and business logic.
- View: Handles layout and display.
- Controller: Routes commands to the model and view parts.
