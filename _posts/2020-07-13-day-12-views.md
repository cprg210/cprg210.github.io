## Goal for the day
By the end of the day, you should have your static HTML pages converted to Pug templates located in a `/views` directory.

## Topic 1: The Big Picture
See [MVC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/MVC) in the MDN glossary

MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a pattern in software design commonly used to implement user interfaces, data, and controlling logic. It emphasizes a separation between the softwareâ€™s business logic and display. This "separation of concerns" provides for a better division of labor and improved maintenance. Some other design patterns are based on MVC, such as MVVM (Model-View-Viewmodel), MVP (Model-View-Presenter), and MVW (Model-View-Whatever).

The three parts of the MVC software-design pattern can be described as follows:

- Model: Manages data and business logic.
- View: Handles layout and display.
- Controller: Routes commands to the model and view parts.

### Activity objectives: Pug project init
1. Copy the files from `express-static` in the backend sample code.
2. Install the following NPM modules:
    - `$ npm install express` (probably already installed)
    - `$ npm install pug`
3. Create a `views` folder in your project root.

## Topic 2: Pug overview
We will be converting the individual animal files in the [backend/1-animals-static](https://github.com/cprg210/sample-code/tree/master/backend/1-animals-static) in the sample-code repository.

## Mid-day Huddle
- who needs help?
- any pivots?
- any show-and-tell?

### Activity objectives: Convert your 3-page website to Pug templates
1. Create and save a `index.pug` file in your `views` directory.
2. Using pug syntax, duplicate (or improve) the HTML structure of your `index.html` static file.
3. Create an endpoint handler for your home page and render your new Pug view.
4. Repeat this process for the other pages of your site.
