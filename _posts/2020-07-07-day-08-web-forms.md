## Topic 1: Javascript overview
We'll take a tour of the Javascript portion of the textbook and overview the major programming concepts associated with Javascript.

### Live-code objectives: Adding machine
- Create a form with the following fields
  - 2 number inputs
  - submit button
- using a form handler, add the two numbers and display the sum to the console.

### Activity: Calculator
Extend the adding machine provided in the live code session and add support for subtraction, multiplication and division using a `select` menu.

## Topic 2: Displaying calculator results on a web page
Using `Element.innerHTML` let's display the result of our calculation on our HTML page.

### Live-code objectives:
- Add a heading or paragraph to the page containing your form.
- Instead of logging the calculator result to the console, display the data in your new element using `Element.innerHTML`.

### Activity: String concatenation
Using template literals, display a sentence that summarizes the results of the calculator.

"[number 1] [multiplied by|plus|minus|divided by] [number 2] equals [result]"

## Mid-day Huddle
