## Topics Covered
- [Express Tutorial: The Local Library website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website)
- [Express Tutorial Part 2: Creating a skeleton website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/skeleton_website)

## Goal for the day
By the end of the day, you should have an Express web server running on port 3000. It should be serving a Hello World website that we will extend later.

## Topic 1: The Big Picture
Before we dig into the details, we'll take a look at the big picture from frontend to backend and everything in the middle:

### Activity objectives: 
See the bottom of [Express Tutorial: The Local Library website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website):

1. Clone the complete [LocalLibrary project](https://github.com/mdn/express-locallibrary-tutorial)
2. on the command line navigate to your new directory and install your dependencies:

```shell
$ npm install
```

3. Now that your dependencies are installed, let's start up the server:

```shell
$ npm run serverstart
```

4. Checkout and expore the website at `localhost:3000`. We'll be using this example to illustrate various features as we build out the project.

## Topic 2: The Model View Controller (MVC) pattern
See [MVC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/MVC) in the MDN glossary

MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a pattern in software design commonly used to implement user interfaces, data, and controlling logic. It emphasizes a separation between the softwareâ€™s business logic and display. This "separation of concerns" provides for a better division of labor and improved maintenance. Some other design patterns are based on MVC, such as MVVM (Model-View-Viewmodel), MVP (Model-View-Presenter), and MVW (Model-View-Whatever).

The three parts of the MVC software-design pattern can be described as follows:

- Model: Manages data and business logic.
- View: Handles layout and display.
- Controller: Routes commands to the model and view parts.
