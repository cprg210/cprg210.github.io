## Topics Covered
- [Express Tutorial Part 3: Using a Database (with Mongoose)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/mongoose)
- [Express Tutorial Part 7: Deploying to production](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/deployment)

## Goal for the day
By the end of the day, you should have a Destinations model defined in your app using Mongoose. It will be connected to your cloud-hosted Atlas Mongo database.

**Important!** DO NOT push your connection code to a public repository until you learn about environment variables tomorrow. For now, either don't push today's code to Github or make your repository private.
